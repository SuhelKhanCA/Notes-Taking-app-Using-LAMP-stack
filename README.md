Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as other 
User (teachers/learners) to provide notes making and maintaining platform in the best 
way possible.
For building this project we will be using Agile Methodology. It is one of the most 
famous software development methodologies which came to prominence in the early 
2000s. The agile process consists of five main activities which are as follows: -
Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction and Deployment. For writing this 
SRS we will be focusing on the first three activities only as those activities together 
make the SRS. The Communication activity deals with interaction and collaboration 
to find the objective and requirement needed for the creation of the project. So this 
part will comprise of project scope, the purpose and so on in the SRS. The Planning 
activity will deal with requirements which included both the functional and nonfunctional requirement. for the project and the most important the increment model. 
The Modeling activity will deal with creation of models (design models) which help 
the user in understanding the WebApp requirements better.
