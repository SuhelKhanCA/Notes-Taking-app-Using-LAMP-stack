                    Inspite of huge influence of technology in our daily lfe, majority of the students still 
                    create their notes manually by pen and paper,while this may work at a lower level 
                    however at a higher level managing these notes becomes a tedious task , also there is 
                    a risk of these paper notes being destroyed or lost.
                    To resolve this problem we have decided to construct a web based application which 
                    would help students to create and manage their notes with ease.Yes the idea of web 
                    based notes app has already been implemented and the app has already been 
                    implemented and the apps are even offering good service to itâ€™s users as such our 
                    main aim behind the construction of this app is to further increase the convenience of 
                    students by manyfold by using these apps as our base and then building upon them.
