## Introduction
NOTER(Notes Taking APP) is a project which aims at developing an online 
application to promote Online Education, maintain Study Materials. Notes Making is 
a Web Based Application which would assist students in carrying their notes 
anywhere anytime. This project has login features, Student as an user can login into 
their own profile separately and create their notes. The Admin can login, through 
which the admin can monitor the whole system. The Admin after logging into his 
account can remove users, add users and much more. Students can login into their
account to retrieve their notes and can also view other students public notes as well.
Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as other 
User (teachers/learners) to provide notes making and maintaining platform in the best 
way possible.
For building this project we will be using Agile Methodology. It is one of the most 
famous software development methodologies which came to prominence in the early 
2000s. The agile process consists of five main activities which are as follows: -
Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction and Deployment. For writing this 
SRS we will be focusing on the first three activities only as those activities together 
make the SRS. The Communication activity deals with interaction and collaboration 
to find the objective and requirement needed for the creation of the project. So this 
part will comprise of project scope, the purpose and so on in the SRS. The Planning 
activity will deal with requirements which included both the functional and nonfunctional requirement. for the project and the most important the increment model. 
The Modeling activity will deal with creation of models (design models) which help 
the user in understanding the WebApp requirements better.
